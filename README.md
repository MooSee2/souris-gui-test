Notes

### Box 2
Need to investigate seepage, but I'm getting the feeling it will be due to precision used in the app vs the excel workbook.

### Box 5
Was previously calculated by ND WSC but is now calculated by downloading the data and summing.  Not sure why they are different.

### Box 8
Off by one because of the workbook using higher precision data than what is available to the app.

### Box 22
The workbook takes a piece-wise approach where it sums data, converts to dam3, then adds.
The app adds then converts to dam3

The workbook also uses higher precision data than what is available to the app.

### Box 40
2023 excel has prelim data, maybe that's the difference?

### Box 43
Same issue as box 5.  How did they calculate this value?
